# Movie Watchlist

Hyper Island - The First App module - Brief 2

### Brief
- Create an app by combining at least two APIs. 
- You have to use a framework or library (like React). 
- You can recreate/build on an old project or create a new one. 
- The project needs to be in a git repository.

### Goals
Deliver a finsihed React project using two APIs. Get an introduction to the Context API.

### Solution
I am a person who has always had a never ending watchlist for movies in the notes on my phone. So I saw this brief as a perfect opportunity to create an app for that instead. The Movie Watchlist is an app where you can search for movies you want to see and add them to a "watchlist", as well as add them to a "watched" list when you've seen them. I decided to pair this with a Lord of the Rings movie quote generator as my second API.

### Learnings
This project ended up being a roller coaster for me. I both learned and struggled a lot.
- I learned more about the fundamentals of React. 
- I got to practice using APIs which I hadn't done in a while. 
- I got introduced to using the Context API. This turned out to be both my biggest struggle and learning, and I would like to use it in another project soon to learn more.
